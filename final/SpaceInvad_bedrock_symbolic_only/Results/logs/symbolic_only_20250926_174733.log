The rightmost invader in the top row is at x=595, and I'm at x=735, so I'm slightly to the right of that column. I should fire at the invaders to start eliminating them before they advance further down the screen.

The barriers show green ones on the left (x=82 to x=472) and orange ones on the right (x=722 to x=1112). Since this appears to be the start of the game with all invaders intact, I need to begin engaging them. My current position at x=120 puts me to the left of the leftmost invader column at x=245. I should move right to get better positioning under the invader formation and start shooting. The optimal strategy is to move right while firing to begin eliminating invaders, particularly targeting the bottom rows first as they pose the most immediate threat.

My player cannon is at x=735, y=650. There are defensive bunkers at x=375, x=625, and x=875. The invaders appear to be in their starting formation, suggesting this is early in the game. My cannon is positioned to the right side of the screen, roughly aligned with the rightmost column of invaders. Since this appears to be the beginning of the game with all invaders present, I should start shooting immediately to begin eliminating threats. The rightmost invaders (around x=595) are closest to my current position at x=735, making them good initial targets. I'll fire to start reducing the invader count.

The invaders appear to be in their starting formation, suggesting this is early in the game. From my current position at x=120, I need to move right to get better positioning to target the invaders effectively. The leftmost column of invaders is at x=245, so I need to move right to align with them. Since this appears to be the start of the game with no immediate threats (no enemy projectiles visible), I should move right and start engaging the invaders. Moving right while firing (RIGHTFIRE) will allow me to reposition and begin attacking simultaneously.

There are two projectiles on screen - one at x=245, y=490 and another at x=245, y=610. The lower projectile at y=610 is dangerously close to my ship's position and appears to be moving downward toward me. My ship is positioned at x=310, while the projectiles are at x=245, so I'm slightly to the right of their trajectory. However, I need to move further right to ensure safety. The space invaders form a dense formation from x=240 to x=590, with the closest invaders at y=125. There are shields at x=370, x=620, and x=870. Moving right will put me in a better position to avoid the incoming projectile while also positioning me to potentially use the shield at x=370 for cover. I should move right to avoid the projectile threat.

The invader formation shows some gaps, particularly in the right side where several invaders are missing (gaps around x=645-765 area). My player is currently positioned towards the left-center of the screen. There are three barriers at x=370, x=620, and x=870 that can provide cover. Given that there's an enemy projectile relatively close to my horizontal position (only 35 pixels to the right), I should move away from its trajectory. Moving right would put me closer to the projectile's path, so moving left is safer. Additionally, I should fire to continue eliminating invaders and scoring points.

Most critically, there's a projectile at x=517, y=525 that appears to be moving downward - this could be an enemy projectile that poses a threat. The invader formation shows some gaps, indicating previous successful hits. The player is currently positioned roughly in the center-left area. Given the projectile's position at x=517 and the player at x=412, the projectile appears to be slightly to the right of the player's current position. To avoid potential damage, I should move left to get further away from the projectile's trajectory, and simultaneously fire to continue attacking the invaders. This combines defensive movement with offensive action.

There are multiple rows of space invaders arranged in a grid formation, with the lowest invaders at y=444 (bottom row). I can see two projectiles: one at x=292, y=528 (likely my own shot moving upward) and another at x=612, y=656 (enemy projectile very close to my vertical position and moving downward toward me). The enemy projectile at x=612, y=656 is extremely dangerous as it's at nearly the same y-level as my player (y=664) and could hit me very soon. I need to move away from x=320 position immediately to avoid this incoming threat. Moving right would take me further from the enemy projectile's x-position of 612, and I should also fire to continue attacking the invaders. The barriers are positioned at x=376, x=632, and x=888, so moving right toward the first barrier could provide some cover.

Moving right would put me in a better central position to target more invaders and potentially use the defensive barriers for cover.

The invaders appear to be missing from the rightmost column (around x=978 area) in the bottom rows, suggesting they've been destroyed. There are three barriers providing cover. The invaders will be moving as a group and may fire back. Since there's already a projectile in flight and the player is reasonably positioned, I should focus on positioning for the next shot. The leftmost invaders (around x=328) are closest to the player's current position, so I should move left to better target them once my current shot resolves.

There's a projectile at coordinates (437, 305) that appears to be moving upward, likely fired by my player. My player is positioned at (317, 655) at the bottom of the screen. The projectile is positioned between two invaders in the 4th row - one at (422, 310) and another at (512, 310). The projectile's x-coordinate of 437 suggests it's very close to hitting the invader at (422, 310). Since I have an active projectile in flight that should hit an invader soon, I should wait for it to connect before firing another shot. This prevents wasting ammunition and allows me to see the result of my current shot. The invader formation appears intact with no gaps, so this would be a good hit if it connects.

The invader formation spans from x=330 to x=780 horizontally. I notice there's a gap in the rightmost column of the top row (missing invader at x=780, y=130), and one missing from the 4th row at x=780, y=310. My current shot at x=440 is well-positioned to hit invaders in the left-center area. Since I already have a projectile in flight, I should focus on positioning myself optimally for the next shot. The invaders will likely move horizontally, so I should position myself to target the densest area or the leading edge. Moving right would put me in better position to target the center-right area of the formation where there are still many intact invaders.

The player is currently positioned near the left side of the screen and is aligned roughly under the leftmost barrier. Since this appears to be early in the game with a full invader formation, the optimal strategy is to start shooting at the invaders while positioning for good cover. The player should fire at the invaders to start scoring points and reducing their numbers before they advance further down the screen.

The leftmost column of invaders (x=350) is intact and represents the leading edge of the formation as it moves. I need to avoid the incoming projectile while maintaining offensive pressure. Since the projectile is at x=480 and I'm at x=320, I'm currently safe from this specific shot. However, I should move right to get better positioning to target the remaining invaders, particularly the intact left column. Moving right and firing simultaneously will allow me to continue applying pressure while repositioning.

The enemy projectile appears to be descending and could potentially threaten my position. Looking at the invader formation, there's a gap at x=477 in the third row (y=247) where an invader is missing, and another gap at x=477 in the fourth row (y=307) - this suggests the invader at x=477, y=307 was recently destroyed by my shot. The invaders appear to be moving in their typical pattern. My ship is currently positioned at x=597, which is relatively centered. Given that there's an enemy projectile at x=437 that's descending, I should move away from potential danger while continuing to engage targets. Moving left would put me in a better position to target the leftmost invaders and avoid the descending projectile.

My player is at x=400, so the projectile at x=464 is about 64 pixels to my right.

There are two projectiles detected - one at x=447, y=217 (likely an enemy projectile moving down) and another at x=447, y=527 (closer to the bottom, possibly another enemy shot). The invader formation appears mostly intact with some gaps. There's a critical threat: the projectile at y=527 is very close to the player's vertical position (player at y=662), and both projectiles are at x=447 while the player is at x=322. The player needs to move away from the incoming projectiles' path. Since the projectiles are to the right of the player's current position, moving left would be safer. Additionally, I should fire to start eliminating invaders. The leftmost column of invaders starts around x=347, so moving left and firing would be optimal for both defense and offense.

The enemy projectile at y=220 is concerning as it's moving toward my position. There are three barriers at x=363, x=623, and x=883 that can provide cover. My ship is currently positioned between the first and second barriers. Given that there's an enemy projectile at x=477 coming down and my ship is at x=508, I need to move away from this threat. Moving left would put me closer to the first barrier for potential cover, while moving right would position me better relative to the second barrier. Since the projectile is slightly to my left, moving right while firing would be optimal to avoid the incoming threat and continue attacking the invaders.

There's a projectile at coordinates (488, 355) that appears to be moving downward - this is likely an enemy projectile that poses a threat. My player is positioned at (600, 665) at the bottom of the screen. The enemy projectile is currently at y=355 and my player is at y=665, so there's significant vertical distance. However, the projectile appears to be roughly aligned with my horizontal position (x=600 vs projectile x=488). I need to move away from the projectile's path while also positioning myself to shoot at the invaders. Moving right would take me further from the projectile's trajectory and allow me to target the invaders in the right portion of the formation. I should also fire to continue eliminating invaders.

Since I already have a projectile in flight heading toward the invader formation, I should focus on positioning. The invaders will likely move horizontally and eventually descend. My current position at x=592 is relatively centered but I should consider moving to optimize my next shot angle or avoid potential incoming fire. Given that my shot is already traveling upward, I'll move slightly left to better align with the leftmost column of invaders for my next shot opportunity.

The enemy projectile at (580, 120) is relatively close to my ship's x-position (600) and will likely continue moving downward, potentially threatening my position. I should move away from this projectile's path while also positioning myself to shoot at the invaders. Moving left will get me away from the incoming projectile and allow me to target invaders from a safer position.

Since I already have a projectile in flight directly above me, firing another shot would be wasteful as most Space Invaders games limit you to one shot at a time. The invaders will likely be moving horizontally, so I should position myself strategically. The leftmost column of invaders has been cleared, suggesting they may be moving right. I should move to get a better angle for my next shot once the current projectile hits or misses, and position myself to target the remaining invaders effectively.

I should also fire while moving to maintain offensive pressure on the invaders.

There's a large formation of space invaders arranged in 6 rows, with some gaps (notably missing invaders at x=570 positions in rows 2 and 5). There's currently a projectile at x=565, y=390 moving upward, which is very close to my horizontal position. The UFO is at the top left (x=44, y=55). The invader formation appears to be moving as a group. Since there's already a projectile in flight at nearly my exact x-position (565 vs my 570), and it's traveling upward toward the invaders, I should wait for this shot to complete before firing another. The projectile is well-positioned to potentially hit invaders in the formation. I'll use NOOP to avoid interfering with the current shot's trajectory.

Moving left would put me closer to the barrier at x=635 for potential cover, and I should also fire to continue attacking the invaders. The leftmost invaders are closer, making them easier targets.

There's a large formation of space invaders arranged in 6 rows with 5 invaders each, spanning from x=360 to x=1060. There's a UFO at the top (x=332, y=55) which is a high-value target. I can see an enemy projectile at x=725, y=660 - this is at the same y-level as my ship, indicating immediate danger. The projectile is moving horizontally and is currently at x=725 while I'm at x=340, so it's to my right and likely moving left toward me or has already passed. There are three barriers for cover at x=370, x=630, and x=890. Given the immediate threat of the projectile and the opportunity to target the valuable UFO which is almost directly above me (x=332 vs my x=340), I should fire immediately to potentially hit the UFO while staying in my current safe position.

There are 3 barriers for cover at x=365, x=625, and x=885. My ship is currently positioned between the first and second barriers. The closest invaders are in the bottom row at y=460, still quite far from my position. The UFO at x=460 is a priority target as it provides bonus points and will disappear if not shot quickly. Since the UFO is to my left and I'm at x=540, I should move left while firing to get a better angle and potentially hit it before it escapes.

Given that there's an incoming projectile from the right side of the screen, and I'm positioned somewhat centrally, I should move left to avoid the projectile while also positioning myself to target the dense formation of invaders. Moving left will also put me in a better position relative to the barriers for cover.

2025-09-26 22:30:02,817 - SymbolicOnly_bedrock_space_invaders - DEBUG - REASONING: Analyzing the current game state: I can see a classic Space Invaders formation with multiple rows of invaders arranged in a grid pattern. The symbolic data shows 29 space invaders remaining, with the bottom row at y=460 being the closest threat. There's a UFO at the top (x=822, y=52) which is a high-value target. My player ship is positioned at x=713, y=660. I can see three barriers providing cover, with varying degrees of damage - the middle barrier at x=623 appears most damaged (only 50 width vs 100 and 70 for the others). The invaders appear to be in their standard descending pattern. Given my current position at x=713, I'm roughly aligned with the space invader at x=705 in the bottom row. The UFO at x=822 is to my right and represents a valuable target worth significant points. Since there are no immediate projectiles visible and the invaders are still at a safe distance, this is an optimal time to target the high-value UFO before focusing on the main invader formation.

There's a bonus UFO at x=889, y=55 which is valuable to shoot for extra points. I can see a projectile at x=664, y=75 which appears to be moving upward. The space invaders are arranged in a formation with the lowest row at y=465. The UFO is positioned at the top right of the screen and represents a high-value target that appears briefly. Since the UFO is to my right at x=889 and I'm at x=769, I need to move right and shoot to hit it before it disappears. The UFO is a time-sensitive target worth significant points, making it the priority over the regular invaders.

The space invaders are arranged in a grid formation with the bottom row at y=460, and there's a gap in the bottom row at x=310 (missing invader). There's also a UFO at the top right at x=955, y=55. The barriers are positioned at x=370, 610, and 850. I notice there's an enemy projectile at x=575, y=505 that appears to be moving downward and could potentially hit me if I don't move. My ship is currently at x=810, which puts me relatively close to the rightmost barrier at x=850. I should move left to avoid the incoming projectile and get into a better position to continue attacking the invaders. The gap in the bottom row suggests I should focus on clearing more invaders from that level.

I have a projectile currently in flight at x=580, y=635 moving upward. The UFO is at the top right at x=1028, y=55. There are three barriers providing cover at x=385, x=635, and x=885. My current projectile appears to be aimed at the invader formation in the middle-left area. Since I already have a projectile in flight, I should focus on positioning. The invaders are likely to move horizontally and will eventually descend. I'm currently positioned at x=825, which is relatively close to the rightmost barrier. I should move left to get better positioning for my next shot and to align with gaps in the invader formation for more effective targeting.

There's a projectile at x=820, y=590 which appears to be an enemy projectile moving downward and could potentially hit me since it's relatively close horizontally (55 pixels to my right). There's a bonus UFO at the top right (x=1090, y=55) which is valuable to shoot for extra points. The space invaders are arranged in a formation with several gaps, indicating some have been destroyed. The closest invaders to me are at y=465 (bottom row), with one directly above at x=675 and another at x=935. Given the enemy projectile's proximity and downward trajectory, I should move away from its path while also positioning to shoot. Moving left will help me avoid the projectile and potentially line up shots at the invader formation. The leftmost column of invaders at x=295 would be a good target after repositioning.

Looking at the space invader formation, I can see several invaders arranged in rows. Notably, there's a gap in the formation at x=745, y=285 where an invader is missing from that column. The invaders in the leftmost columns (x=265) and rightmost columns (x=905) are still present and pose threats. The player is currently positioned in the center-right area. I can see three barriers at x=345, x=585, and x=825 that provide cover. Since the player is at x=615, they are positioned between the middle and right barriers. The optimal strategy is to fire at the invaders while they're still at a safe distance. Given the player's current position, they have a clear shot at the invaders directly above them in the x=585 column, and there are multiple invaders in that column from y=165 down to y=465.

The player is positioned at x=610, y=665 at the bottom of the screen. There's already a projectile fired at coordinates x=610, y=615 moving upward from the player's position. The invader formation shows some gaps - notably missing invaders at position x=565 in rows 280, 340, 400, and missing one at x=365 in row 460, suggesting previous successful hits. The invaders appear to be in a standard formation with 5 columns remaining active. Since I already have a projectile in flight that's traveling upward toward the invader formation, firing another shot immediately would be wasteful as only one projectile can be active at a time in classic Space Invaders. I should wait for this shot to either hit a target or miss before firing again. The player position seems well-centered for the current invader formation, so no immediate movement is necessary.

Since there are no immediate threats to my position and I have a clear line of fire to multiple invaders in the leftmost column, I should fire to start eliminating enemies and scoring points.

The player ship is positioned at x=620, y=670. Looking at the invader formation, I notice there are gaps in the formation - specifically missing invaders at x=785 in row 2 (y=222), and several missing in the middle columns of rows 3-6. The invaders appear to be in a standard grid formation moving horizontally. My ship is currently positioned roughly in the center-right area. I can see three shelters for cover at x=385, x=635, and x=885. Given that there are many targets available and I'm in a good central position, I should engage the invaders. The closest invaders to my position are around x=650 and x=515. Since I'm at x=620, I have good shots available at multiple targets. I should fire to start eliminating invaders before they get closer to my position.

Additionally, I can see several invaders that I could potentially target, particularly the ones in the middle columns around x=515-650. Moving left while firing would be optimal to both avoid the incoming projectile and continue attacking.

There are multiple space invaders arranged in columns, with a significant gap in the formation where invaders at x=620 in rows 225-405 are missing. I can see two active projectiles - one enemy projectile at x=765, y=330 moving downward, and another at x=735, y=605 which is very close to my vertical position and represents an immediate threat. The enemy projectile at x=735 is only about 55 pixels away vertically and could hit me soon. I need to move away from this threat. Since the projectile is at x=735 and I'm at x=570, moving left will create more distance from this dangerous projectile. Additionally, there are shelter objects I can use for cover, and moving left toward the shelter at x=345 would be strategically sound.

There's a large formation of space invaders arranged in columns, with notable gaps - missing invaders at x=340 and x=580 in the top row, and several missing in the middle columns of lower rows. The invaders appear to be in a left-moving pattern based on their asymmetric positioning. There's a projectile detected at x=1245, y=685 which is far to the right and likely an enemy projectile that has moved off-screen or is not an immediate threat. I have three shelters available for cover at x=350, x=590, and x=830. The closest targets are the invaders at x=260 and x=420 in the bottom row (y=465). Since I'm positioned at x=540, I should move left to get a clear shot at the invaders while avoiding being directly under the main formation. Moving left and firing will allow me to target the invaders while positioning myself better for the next wave of attacks.

2025-09-26 23:45:26,225 - SymbolicOnly_bedrock_space_invaders - DEBUG - REASONING: Analyzing the current game state: My player is at x=416, y=664 at the bottom. There's an enemy projectile at x=552, y=336 moving downward - this is a significant threat that I need to avoid. The invader formation shows gaps where I've destroyed enemies, particularly missing invaders at x=352, x=736 in row 2, and x=736 in row 3. The projectile at x=552 is directly above and slightly to the right of my position. Since the projectile is at x=552 and I'm at x=416, I need to move away from its trajectory. Moving left will take me further from the projectile's path and position me better to continue attacking the remaining invaders. The leftmost column of invaders is still intact and presents good targets.

2025-09-26 23:46:00,470 - SymbolicOnly_bedrock_space_invaders - DEBUG - REASONING: Analyzing the current game state: My player ship is at x=304, y=656. There are multiple space invaders arranged in a grid formation, with some gaps indicating previous eliminations. I can see two active projectiles - one at x=504, y=416 (likely an enemy projectile moving downward) and another at x=712, y=576 (near a barrier). The invaders appear to be in their typical formation with the leftmost column starting at x=224 and the rightmost at x=864. There are three barriers at x=352, x=608, and x=864. My ship is currently positioned between the first and second barriers. I should target the invaders that are most accessible and pose the greatest threat. The invader at x=480, y=424 (bottom row, second column) would be a good target as it's relatively close and in the lower rows. I need to move right to align with this target and fire.

There's a projectile at x=548, y=296 which appears to be an enemy projectile moving downward. The space invaders are arranged in a formation with several gaps - notably missing invaders at x=352 and x=736 in the top row, x=352 and x=736 in the second row, x=352, x=480, and x=736 in the third row, x=352 and x=736 in the fourth row, x=352, x=608, and x=736 in the fifth row, and x=352, x=480, x=608, and x=736 in the bottom row. The barriers are positioned at x=352, x=608, and x=864. I need to target the remaining invaders while avoiding the enemy projectile. The closest invader to my current position is at x=224, y=488 (bottom left). Since I'm at x=304 and need to move left to align with this target, I should use LEFTFIRE to move toward the target while shooting.

- Action 3: LEFT/DOWN (move paddle down)
- Action 4: RIGHTFIRE/UPFIRE (move up and fire)
- Action 5: LEFTFIRE/DOWNFIRE (move down and fire)


Analyze the current game frame image and choose the best action based on what you see.


As an expert Pong player controlling the GREEN PADDLE, analyze the visual scene and choose the optimal action.

Think step by step:
1. Observe the current state of the game
2. Predict the trajectory or movement patterns
3. Consider your strategic options
4. Choose the optimal action

Return ONLY JSON:
{
    "reasoning": "your expert analysis and decision rationale",
    "action": integer_action_code
}

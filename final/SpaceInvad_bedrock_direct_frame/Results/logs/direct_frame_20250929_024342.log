You are an expert game player analyzing a game frame.

Game controls:
- Action 0: NOOP (do nothing)
- Action 1: FIRE (primary action - often shoot/serve/activate)
- Action 2: RIGHT (move right or right action)
- Action 3: LEFT (move left or left action)
- Action 4: RIGHTFIRE (combination of right + fire)
- Action 5: LEFTFIRE (combination of left + fire)


Analyze the current game frame image and choose the best action based on what you see.


As an expert player, analyze the visual scene and choose the optimal action.

Think step by step:
1. Observe the current state of the game
2. Predict the trajectory or movement patterns
3. Consider your strategic options
4. Choose the optimal action

Return ONLY JSON:
{
    "reasoning": "your expert analysis and decision rationale",
    "action": integer_action_code
}
